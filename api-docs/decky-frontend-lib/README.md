## Developers and Contributors

This library is focused on usage by developers to provide custom React components based on those found in the Steam Deck's React UI.  
This method allows developers to add UI elements and code without clobbering the existing UI of the deck in order to do so.  
This library can also theoretically be used to extend existing UI elements of the Steam Deck UI but this has not been tested extensively.
