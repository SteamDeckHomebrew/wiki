# Plugin Browser

While the PluginLoader can run any plugins you load into it, no matter the source, it does have an integrated installer for downloading and installing plugins from external sources (Github for now). One such source of plugins, and the one we maintain, is **[plugins.deckbrew.xyz](https://plugins.deckbrew.xyz)**.

Once you find a plugin you like all you have to do is press **Install** and the site will send an install request to the PluginLoader. Then you have to open your plugin menu and either accept or reject the request.
