# Decky Loader

## About
Decky Loader (formerly known as PluginLoader) is an open source project written in Python with the goal of adding plugin-loading capabilities to the Steam Deck. After installing, plugins can be accessed using a plugins tab in the quick access menu.

### Note for HoloISO Users

Decky does not support HoloISO out of the box.
The install pre-release script encounters issues related to jq and curl.
We'd like to expand our support but don't have the time to do so. We invite pull-requests to resolve such issues.
