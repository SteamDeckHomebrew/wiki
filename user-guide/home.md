# Decky Loader

## About
Decky Loader (formerly known as PluginLoader) is an open source project written in Python and react (and with support for custom backends other than python!) with the goal of adding plugin-loading capabilities to the Steam Deck. After installing, plugins can be accessed using a plugins tab in the quick access menu.

### Note for HoloISO Users

Decky does not support HoloISO out of the box.
The install pre-release script encounters issues related to jq and curl.
We'd like to expand our support but don't have the time to do so. We invite pull-requests to resolve such issues.
