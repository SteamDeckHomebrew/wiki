# Plugin Store

## General Information

Decky Loader can run any of these types of plugins:

  - built React based plugin
  - non-ui plugins for pure background functionality (planned)
  - legacy python plugin

But, the recommended and only method for installing plugins which provide support for is the usage of the integrated installer for installing plugins called Plugin Store.
The Plugin Store is built-in to the UI of Decky Loader.
To see a web preview, go to **[plugins.deckbrew.xyz](https://plugins.deckbrew.xyz)**.
Pre-release and testing versions use **[testing.deckbrew.xyz](https://testing.deckbrew.xyz)**.

The Plugin Store has all of it's plugins reviewed then approved by a member of our development staff and given our seal of approval.

## Using the Store

First, navigate to the the Decky Loader tab in the Quick Acess Menu (QAM).
